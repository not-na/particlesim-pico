// This file defines the settings and order in which stages are presented
// IMPORTANT: Only comments and STAGE / STAGE_ADV macros are allowed here
// STAGE(NAME) takes the name of an image, capitalized and without the IMG_ prefix
// STAGE_ADV(NAME, BGNAME, SCALE, ELASTICITY, RAND) takes more arguments:
// BGNAME: same as NAME of STAGE(), since NAME here can be anything (for re-using the
// same image for multiple stages
// SCALE: MPU_SCALE for default, else a value between 1 and 255
// ELASTICITY: SIM_ELASTICITY for default, else a value between 1 and 255
// RAND: whether to enable random jitter to increase realism. Not recommended for small particle counts

// Add new stages by appending a line with STAGE(<capitalized filename without img_ prefix and file ending>)
