// This file defines the order in which universes are selectable
// Important: only comments and UNIVERSE macros are allowed here
// UNIVERSE(NAME) takes the name of a universe, without the the gol_ prefix and capitalized
// UNIVERSE_NOPER(NAME) is the same as UNIVERSE(NAME), but disables auto-restarting if a short periodic cycle is detected
// RANDUNIVERSE(NAME, PROB) takes a name and a probability for each tile to be alive at the start of the soup

// Add new universes by appending a line with UNIVERSE(<capitalized filename without gol_ prefix and file ending>)
